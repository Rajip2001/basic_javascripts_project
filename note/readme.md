# Notes App

A simple Notes application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, view, and delete notes. The notes are stored locally in the browser using `localStorage`, so they persist even after refreshing the page.

## Features

- Add notes
- View added notes
- Delete notes
- Uses `localStorage` to persist notes

## How It Works

- **Add Note**: Users can type a note in the text area and click the "Add Note" button to save it. The note will then be displayed below.
- **View Notes**: All the saved notes are displayed in a card format with the option to delete each note.
- **Delete Note**: Each note card has a delete button. Clicking the "Delete" button removes the note from the local storage and updates the view.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the application.
- **CSS**: For basic styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: To handle functionality like adding and deleting notes and interacting with the browser's `localStorage`.
